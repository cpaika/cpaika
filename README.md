### Hey, I'm Chris 👋

I'm a software engineer, temporarily taking a break in between jobs.

I write about my experience leading teams and building infrastructure at [paika.tech](https://paika.tech/)

[I'm always happy to talk to engineers or anyone starting in the industry.](https://paika.tech/standing-invitation/)  Feel free to reach out.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, boating, and spending time with my dog Ruby 🐕
