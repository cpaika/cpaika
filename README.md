### Hey, I'm Chris 👋

I'm a software engineer, currently working on building a new application development platform at Constant Contact.

I write about my experience leading teams and building infrastructure at [paika.tech](https://paika.tech/)

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, boating, and spending time with my dog Ruby 🐕
